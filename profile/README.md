## Overview

Smartswap is an intranet-based project designed to take automated positions in cryptocurrency markets using strategies developed through quantitative backtesting, interacting with centralized platforms such as Binance. The platform facilitates automated trading through a trading algorithm based on quantitative market analysis. You can create, import, and simulate your own strategies, as well as run multiple automated trading strategies using a web interface and fast APIs.

### How it works

- Use **simonpotel/QTSBE** and **smartswap-org/webapp** to create and visualize your trading strategy, including metrics, cumulative returns, and positions across multiple pairs. Utilize the lab for faster analysis and charts for detailed insights.

- Import your strategy into **QTB** in simulation mode, where it will automatically manage positions on CEX/DEX using **simonpotel/CEXcryptoLib** and **simonpotel/DEXcryptoLib**. Data will be recorded in **smartswap** databases for real-time visualization.

- If effective, switch to live trading to start generating profits.

- **QTB** includes Discord integration for faster position monitoring and enhanced configurations.

- The platform features multiple logging levels and security measures, including a phone call system for critical logs.

- The infrastructure is designed for efficient strategy creation, upload, visualization, and automated monitoring.

- [**CEXcryptoLib**](https://github.com/simonpotel/CEXcryptoLib) & [**DEXcryptoLib**](https://github.com/simonpotel/DEXcryptoLib): Libraries for executing orders and broadcasting transactions on markets.

### Internal Modules

- [**webapp**](https://github.com/smartswap-org/webapp): A web interface for portfolio management, order tracking, and cryptocurrency price monitoring (DEX/CEX). It includes features like Charts for enhanced strategy analysis and Lab for obtaining stats on over 50 cryptocurrencies in just 5 seconds.

- [**simulator**](https://github.com/smartswap-org/simulator): A real-time strategy simulation tool for testing bag management and position strategies. It simulates buy/sell signals across multiple pairs and provides comprehensive backtest statistics.

- [**qtb**](https://github.com/smartswap-org/qtb): The central module that retrieves strategies, signals, and executes transactions. It can operate in simulation mode for live statistics, which is not available in the simulator. The **qtbapp** module integrates with Discord for faster admin control, including phone call management and configurations.

- [**databases**](https://github.com/smartswap-org/databases): Manages the creation and updating of the smartswap database, handling user logins for the webapp and position management for QTB configurations.
